What is my current idea of what makes up a game?
You have 3 core systems:
1. Input
2. logic
3. graphics

what makes up the game
graphics
data
logic


I need a physics system...
First thing's first. I need box colliders.
I also need to reorginize everything


how will the physics system get its mesh information and what information does it need?

for every triangle it needs:
	vertices,
	normals,
	indices (determines winding order)
