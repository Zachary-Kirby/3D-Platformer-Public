This a rough project where I implemented a 3D platformer using OpenGL, Assimp. 
Getting started I used LearnOpenGL.com and the OpenGL documentation. 
So, when it comes to graphics, my code may not be fully original. 
Otherwise, everything involving collisions is mine and based on a rough understanding of the Separating Axis Theorem.
